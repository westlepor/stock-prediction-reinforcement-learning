This is the code for "Reinforcement Learning for Stock Prediction" By Siraj Raval on Youtube

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/05NqKJ0v7EE) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval on reinforcemenet learning for stock prediction.

## Dependencies

* yahoo_finance 
* matplotlib 
* numpy 
* tensorflow 

Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install any of these dependencies, i.e pip install yahoo_finance.

## Usage

Run this code in terminal via 'python stock_predict.py' to have it pull stock prices from the Web then train the Q learning agent on them, using practice funds to execute trades. It will improve over time, you can use it to execute trades with real money by using the [oanda](https://www.oanda.com/) API.
